Using SQL to determine which subsystems are active or not
---------------------------------------------------------
list all subsystems and whether they are active
When I wrote about how it is possible to check if a subsystem is active or not someone asked me if there is a way to list all the subsystems and whether they are active or not.

Having had some time to "play" I have developed a way of doing this by combining data from the following two SQL table functions:

OBJECT_STATISTICS
ACTIVE_JOB_INFO
I can get a list of all subsystem description objects by using the OBJECT_STATISTICS table function:

01  SELECT OBJLONGSCHEMA,OBJNAME
02    FROM TABLE(QSYS2.OBJECT_STATISTICS('*ALL','SBSD')) A
03   ORDER BY 2,1
Line 1: I just want the object library and object name returned in the results.

Line 2: OBJECT_STATISTICS allows me to select which libraries and object types I want returned. In this case the *ALL means all libraries, and SBSD is subsystem descriptions.

Line 3: Rather than list the column names I want to order the results by I can use their column position. In this examples I want to order first by the object name, and then by its library.

The IBM i partition I ran this statement on has the following subsystem description objects:

OBJLONGSCHEMA  OBJNAME
-------------  -----------
QSYS           QBASE
QSYS           QBATCH
QSYS           QCMN
QSYS           QCTL
-              QDSNX
QGPL           QFNC
QHTTPSVR       QHTTPSVR
QSYS           QINTER
-              QLPINSTALL
QSYS           QPGMR
QSYS           QSERVER
QSYS           QSNADS
QSYS           QSPL
QSYS           QSYSSBSD
QSYS           QSYSWRK
QSYS           QUSRWRK
QGPL           RZKHWORK
Just because the subsystem object exists does not mean that it is active. This is where the ACTIVE_JOB_INFO table function comes into play. I noticed that for every active subsystem there was a job where the JOB_TYPE column contained the value 'SBS'. This information allows me to get a list of active subsystems by using this SQL statement.

01  SELECT SUBSYSTEM,SUBSYSTEM_LIBRARY_NAME
02    FROM TABLE(QSYS2.ACTIVE_JOB_INFO()) B
03   WHERE JOB_TYPE = 'SBS'
04   ORDER BY 1
Line 1: I want the subsystem name and the library it is in returned in the results.

line 3: Only where the JOB_TYPE is equal to 'SBS'.

Line 4: And order by subsystem name.

The results are as follows:

SUBSYSTEM  SUBSYSTEM_LIBRARY_NAME
---------  ----------------------
QBATCH     QSYS
QCMN       QSYS
QCTL       QSYS
QINTER     QSYS
QSERVER    QSYS
QSPL       QSYS
QSYSWRK    QSYS
QUSRWRK    QSYS
RZKHWORK   QGPL
And now to combine the two:

01  SELECT DISTINCT
02      CAST(A.OBJLONGSCHEMA AS CHAR(10)) AS "Library",
03      A.OBJNAME AS "Subsystem",
04      CASE WHEN B.SUBSYSTEM IS NULL THEN 'Inactive'
05      ELSE 'Active'
06      END as "Status"
07     FROM TABLE(QSYS2.OBJECT_STATISTICS('*ALL','SBSD')) A
08      LEFT OUTER JOIN TABLE(QSYS2.ACTIVE_JOB_INFO()) B
09        ON A.OBJNAME = B.SUBSYSTEM
10       AND A.OBJLONGSCHEMA = B.SUBSYSTEM_LIBRARY_NAME
11   ORDER BY 2,1
Line 1: This is one type of Select I don't think I have used in a post in this blog before: SELECT DISTINCT. What this does is return only those rows that are distinct (different), in other words if there are repeating rows in the results only one is returned. I need this as without it I will get multiple rows returned from the active subsystems, one row for each job active within the subsystem.

Line 2: I am casting the 128 long object schema name from the OBJECT_STATISTICS into a ten long library name, notice that the column heading "Library" is within double apostrophes ( " ).

Line 3: Object name, that will contain the subsystem name.

Line 4 - 6: I am using the CASE statement to make this column be either 'Active' or 'Inactive'. When I perform the test for null I have to say IS NOT NULL as a column cannot be equal to null. If the column is null then this statement will put 'Inactive' in the column. If it is not null then 'Active'.

Lines 7 – 10: This is the part that joins the two table functions with a LEFT OUTER JOIN. This means that if no match is found to the subsystem description returned by OBJECT_STATISTICS in ACTIVE_JOB_INFO then the third column will be null. If it a match is found the third column will contain the subsystem name. Why do we not see that in the results? Lines 4 – 6 overwrite the value in the third column.

Line 11: I want to order my results by library and then by subsystem.

The results look like:

Library     Subsystem   Status
----------  ----------  ----------
QSYS        QBASE       Inactive
QSYS        QBATCH      Active
QSYS        QCMN        Active
QSYS        QCTL        Active
-           QDSNX       Inactive
QGPL        QFNC        Inactive
QHTTPSVR    QHTTPSVR    Inactive
QSYS        QINTER      Active
-           QLPINSTALL  Inactive
QSYS        QPGMR       Inactive
QSYS        QSERVER     Active
QSYS        QSNADS      Inactive
QSYS        QSPL        Active
QSYS        QSYSSBSD    Inactive
QSYS        QSYSWRK     Active
QSYS        QUSRWRK     Active
QGPL        RZKHWORK    Active
No one wants to key that statement in every time they want these results. I created myself a SQL View that I could use:

01  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW MYLIB.SBSSTATUS
02    (SBSLIB,SBSNAME,SBSSTS)
03  AS SELECT DISTINCT
04         CAST(A.OBJLONGSCHEMA AS CHAR(10)),
05         A.OBJNAME,
06         CASE WHEN B.SUBSYSTEM IS NULL THEN 'Inactive'
07         ELSE 'Active'
08         END
09       FROM TABLE(QSYS2.OBJECT_STATISTICS('*ALL','SBSD')) A
10         LEFT OUTER JOIN TABLE(QSYS2.ACTIVE_JOB_INFO()) B
12           ON A.OBJNAME = B.SUBSYSTEM
13          AND A.OBJLONGSCHEMA = B.SUBSYSTEM_LIBRARY_NAME ;

14  LABEL ON COLUMN SBSSTATUS
15   (SBSLIB IS 'Library',
16   SBSNAME IS 'Subsystem',
17    SBSSTS IS 'Status') ;

18  LABEL ON COLUMN SBSSTATUS
19   (SBSLIB TEXT IS 'Subsystem library',
20   SBSNAME TEXT IS 'Subsystem name',
21    SBSSTS TEXT IS 'Subsystem status') ;

22  LABEL ON TABLE SBSSTATUS IS 'Subsystem statuses' ;
Lines 1: My view will be called SBSSTATUS.

Line 2: It will contain three columns.

Lines 3 – 13: This is my previous SQL Select statement.

Lines 14 – 17: Giving the columns the equivalent of column headings.

Lines 18 – 21: Giving the columns the equivalent of column text.

Line 22: Giving the generated object a system description.

Now whenever I want to know the status of the subsystems I can just use the following SQL statement:

SELECT * FROM MYLIB.SBSSTATUS
 ORDER BY 2,1
The results look the same as the combined SQL statement:

SBSLIB      SBSNAME     SBSSTS
----------  ----------  ----------
QSYS        QBASE       Inactive
QSYS        QBATCH      Active
QSYS        QCMN        Active
QSYS        QCTL        Active
-           QDSNX       Inactive
QGPL        QFNC        Inactive
QHTTPSVR    QHTTPSVR    Inactive
QSYS        QINTER      Active
-           QLPINSTALL  Inactive
QSYS        QPGMR       Inactive
QSYS        QSERVER     Active
QSYS        QSNADS      Inactive
QSYS        QSPL        Active
QSYS        QSYSSBSD    Inactive
QSYS        QSYSWRK     Active
QSYS        QUSRWRK     Active
QGPL        RZKHWORK    Active
